# Arandu Network – Context

Arandu is the 2025 reboot of an older idea called **SciTorrent**: a network for open, reproducible, and ethical science.

Long-term vision (NOT for the MVP):

- A decentralized network where papers, code, data and claims are:
  - discoverable,
  - executable,
  - verifiable,
  - auditable.
- Agentic AI fabric that:
  - indexes research,
  - attempts reproductions,
  - generates explanations and educational artifacts,
  - helps match collaborators and reviewers.
- Epistemic ledger that tracks:
  - truth (reproducibility, consistency),
  - cooperation (collaborative behavior),
  - ethics (responsibility, risk management).
- Funding and grants model:
  - fair, sustainable, and impact-focused,
  - reinvesting surplus in infrastructure, R&D, and underrepresented regions and talents.

Current focus (MVP):

- **Arandu Repro v0** – a small service that:
  - takes a GitHub repo (and optionally a paper / arXiv ID),
  - builds a runnable environment,
  - executes a command inside a container,
  - generates:
    - a reproducibility report,
    - an executable notebook,
    - an optional badge snippet for the README.

The long-term vision is important for coherence, but the MVP must be extremely narrow and pragmatic.
