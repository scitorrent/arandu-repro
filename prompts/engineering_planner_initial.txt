Given your role as Arandu Engineering Planner and the MVP definition above, create a detailed engineering plan for **Arandu Repro v0**.

Deliverables:

1. Architecture v0
   - High-level diagram in text form (components and how they talk).
   - Tech stack choices (backend framework, DB, worker strategy, containerization, minimal frontend).
   - Data model draft (tables/entities for jobs, runs, artifacts).

2. Repository plan
   - Which repositories we need now (mono-repo vs multiple).
   - Suggested folder structure for the main repo.
   - Config files to have from day 1 (Dockerfile, docker-compose, CI config, etc.).

3. 4–6 week execution plan
   - Split into 2 or 3 sprints (Sprint 0, Sprint 1, Sprint 2).
   - For each sprint, define goals and "definition of done".
   - Emphasize: Sprint 0 = setup, Sprint 1 = core pipeline, Sprint 2 = UX / Aha moment.

4. Backlog as GitHub-style issues
   - ~20–30 issues with:
     - Title
     - Short description
     - Suggested labels
     - Acceptance criteria
   - Mark MUST vs NICE-TO-HAVE.

5. Risks and simplifications
   - Main technical risks.
   - Simplifications to keep v0 deliverable within 4–6 weeks.
   - Items of the long-term vision explicitly deferred to Phase 2+.

Do NOT generate implementation code; focus on architecture, planning, and backlog design.
