You have the high-level Arandu Repro v0 plan from the Engineering Planner.

Task:
1. Propose a concrete v0 architecture for a single-repo implementation:
   - Components and how they communicate (API, worker, env builder, executor, storage).
   - Exact tech choices (framework, DB, queue/worker, Docker strategy, minimal frontend).
2. Define the initial data model (entities + key fields).
3. Define the core Python modules and their responsibilities.
4. Write interface contracts for:
   - job creation,
   - repo cloning,
   - environment detection/build,
   - command execution,
   - report/notebook generation,
   - status querying.

Keep it focused on what we need to implement in the first 4–6 weeks.

Do not write full implementations, just interfaces and structure.
