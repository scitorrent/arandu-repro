We have:
- An MVP scope for Arandu Repro v0.
- An architecture and module design from the Architect Agent.

Your task now:
1. Propose the first implementation steps for Sprint 0 and Sprint 1:
   - Which files and modules to create,
   - Minimal code scaffolding (FastAPI app, DB models, job queue, etc.),
   - Basic Docker / docker-compose setup.
2. Then, start implementing the most fundamental pieces:
   - Healthcheck endpoint,
   - Job model + migration,
   - `POST /jobs` endpoint that stores a job in the DB.

First, explain the plan.

Only then, when explicitly asked, start writing code in small, reviewable chunks.
