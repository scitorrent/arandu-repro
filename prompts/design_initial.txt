Design a v0 design system and basic UI for **Arandu Repro v0**, based on your system instructions.

Deliverables:

1. Brand & Mood
   - Short description of the feeling a user should have when visiting Arandu Repro.
   - 3–5 adjectives that define the tone.

2. Color System
   - Small set of core colors with names and hex values:
     - background, surface, border, primary text, secondary text,
     - primary moss green, secondary green, secondary blue, success, warning.
   - Provide as CSS variables.

3. Typography & Spacing
   - Suggest font families (with fallbacks).
   - Define a simple type scale (H1, H2, H3, body, small).
   - Define a spacing scale.

4. Core Components
   - Buttons (primary, secondary, subtle).
   - Cards (for jobs, reports).
   - Status badges (pending, running, success, partial, failed).
   - Navigation bar.
   - Simple table/list for jobs.

5. Key Screens (wireframes in text)
   - Home / Landing
   - Jobs overview
   - Job detail (status, logs, report link, notebook link, badge snippet)

Keep it pragmatic and implementable in a small Next.js or server-rendered frontend.

Do not generate the full app code; focus on design tokens, component definitions, and layout descriptions.
